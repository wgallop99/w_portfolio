			I moved to Charleston, SC in the summer of 2013 after graduating college with a degree in Business Administration. The exponential growth of the Charleston tech scene inspired me to learn more about websites and the tech involved behind them. I began taking night classes at The Digital Corridor with no real intention of allowing code to take over my life, however, it did.</br>
			
			After committing to my new found passion, I decided the next step had to be a big one. The Iron Yard, a three month programming fist-fight, was the path I would persue. The Front-End engineering discipline interested me because of it's emphasis on responsive design combined with effective re-usable functionality.</br>

			Fast-forward to now and I know I'm ready. Ready to continue my never-ending quest with code.

				<p>My experience with the Front-End includes HTML5 and CSS3 extended with LESS and SASS pre-processers. In addition to building dynamic web applications from the ground up with Vanilla Javascript and jQuery, I have also developed full-stack applications with Angular and the rest of the MEAN ecosystem.</p>

				<h3><i class="fa fa-server"></i></h3>
				<p>I have an advanced background with server-side languages such as PHP and Node. I have leveraged Content Management Technologies such as Wordpress and Jekyll (this site), with a mastery of Drupal and its many modules.</p>

				<p>My design skillset is largely centered around the Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Photoshop and Illustrator. For wireframing and mockups I prefer to use tools like Omnigraffle and Balsamiq for their ease of use.</p>
