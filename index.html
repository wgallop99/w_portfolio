			I am a highly motivated developer with a specialty in front-end web development. I have a
			curiosity that pushes me to learn new technologies on the fly, while at the same time
			remaining vigilant on perfecting processes I have already grasped, such as HTML5, CSS3,
			and JavaScript.</br>
			My portfolio contains projects that I planned, designed, and assembled from the ground
			up as well as projects that required collaborations between designers, SEO specialists,
			and project managers. I enjoyed every minute of all of them, and I am always looking for
			new challenges.</br>
			Currently, I live in Charleston, South Carolina working as a Senior Web Developer for
			Benefitfocus, a leading benefits management software company.

				<p>My experience with the Front-End includes HTML5 and CSS3 extended with LESS and SASS pre-processers. In addition to building dynamic web applications from the ground up with Vanilla Javascript and jQuery, I have also developed full-stack applications with Angular and the rest of the MEAN ecosystem.</p>
