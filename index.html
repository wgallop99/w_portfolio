			I am a highly motivated developer with a specialty in front-end web development. I have a
			curiosity that pushes me to learn new technologies on the fly, and at the same time I remain vigilant on perfecting processes I have already grasped, such as HTML5, CSS3,
			and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p>
			My portfolio contains projects that I planned, designed, and assembled from the ground
			up, as well as projects that required collaborations between designers, SEO specialists,
			and project managers. I enjoyed every minute of all of them, and I am always looking for
			new challenges.
		</p>
		<p>
			I currently live in Charleston, South Carolina working as a Senior Web Developer for
			Benefitfocus, a leading benefits management software company.
