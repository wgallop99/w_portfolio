      <h2>Benefitfocus</h2>
      <p>Drupal Website</p>
      <div class="featured-project-description">
        <p>My first Drupal project was a doozy. This reputable benefits management software company required an equally reputable website, complete with a sleek User Interface, built to drive lead generation and tell a story. The website is fully responsive and is referenced as a leading source for content in the Benefits Industry.</p>

      <h2>Benefitfocus Media</h2>
      <p>Drupal Branded Web App</p>
      <div class="featured-project-description">
        <p>The challenge of developing an application that was simplistic from a content manager's perspective, and yet beautiful from a user's occurred in this project posed by the Media team at Benefitfocus. Their clients needed a way to send employees branded videos and video collections in order to train, update, or educate them on an array of issues. Using Drupal, I was able to satisfy both parties concerns.</p>
